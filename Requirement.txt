Thank you for your interest in our job opening. As a next step, please complete this short assignment: a mini HR job board with resume parsing.

Objective
Build a small web app where recruiters post jobs, and candidates apply by uploading a resume. Upon upload, a third-party API (mock or real) parses key details, which are displayed in the recruiter’s dashboard.

Requirements

Data Model & DB
User (id, email, password, role)
Job (id, title, description, status)
Application (id, candidateId, jobId, resumeUrl, parsed fields)
Back-End API (JWT/session-based)
Auth: POST /auth/register, POST /auth/login
Jobs (recruiter only): POST/GET/PUT/DELETE /jobs
Resume Parsing: POST /applications (accept file/link, call parser API, store results)
Front-End (any modern framework)
Login/Register for recruiters/candidates
Job Listings (public); recruiters manage jobs
Apply (candidate uploads resume)
Dashboard (recruiters see parsed details)
Security
Recruiters only manage postings/view applications
Candidates can see jobs, apply, view their own status
Documentation
A brief README on setup, usage, and API testing
